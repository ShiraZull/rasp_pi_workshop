run install workshop dependencies script
prepare 5 red, 3 blue and 7 white wires with one led, resistor, humidity sensor and breadboard
build a control breadboard to test all raspberry pi stations (both before and potentially during the workshop)
copy this code into main.py and run to test if everything works
