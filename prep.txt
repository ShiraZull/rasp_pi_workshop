- First make a $ git pull
- Run $ ./install_workshop_dependencies.sh
- Prepare: 
    - 1 breadboard
    - 15 wires
        - 5 red
        - 3 blue
        - 7 white
    - 1 LED lamp
    - 1 resistor
    - 1 humidity sensor
    - 1 motion sensor
- Assemble the breadboard according to the schematics, this will act as a control unit.
    The control unit will be used on all workstations both before and during the workshop (in case of debugging)
- Copy the code below into main.py to run and test if everything works

def main():
    # Your code goes here
    print("Testing workshop")
    c = 0
    while c <= 3:
        c += 1
        print(c)

    c = 0
    print("The LED lamp should blink for 5 seconds")
    while c < 5:
        led_on()
        sleep(.5)
        led_off()
        sleep(.5)
        c += 1

    c = 0
    print("The terminal should display humidity, temp and motion for 20 seconds\nand the LED should blink")
    while c < 20:
        led_on() if c%2==0 else led_off()
        print(f"Temperature: {read_sensor_temperature()}C")
        print(f"Humidity: {read_sensor_humidity()}%")
        string = "MOTION DETECTED!" if read_sensor_motion() else "No motion..."
        print(f"Motion: {string}")
        c += 1
        sleep(1)

    # Your code ends here
    return 0
